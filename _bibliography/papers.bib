  title="{Joint Content-Context Analysis of Scientific Publications: Identifying Opportunities for Collaboration in Cognitive Science}",
  author={Lu Cheng*, **Girish Ganesan\***, William He*, Daniel Silverston*, Harlin Lee, Jacob G. Foster},
  abstract={This work studies publications in the field of cognitive science and utilizes mathematical techniques to connect the analysis of the papers' content (abstracts) to the context (citation, journals). We apply hierarchical topic modeling on the abstracts and community detection algorithms on the citation network, and measure content-context discrepancy to find academic fields that study similar topics but do not cite each other or publish in the same venues. These results show a promising, systemic framework to identify opportunities for scientific collaboration in highly interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science and machine learning.},

  title="{Islamic State Resurgence in the Era of COVID-19}",
  author={Stacey Pollard, Henry Baraket, **Girish Ganesan**, Natalie Kim},
  abstract={One year after US-led coalition operations liberated ISIS-held territories in Iraq and Syria and killed ISIS-core leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS is resurging. Taking a page from its old playbook, the organization is capitalizing on social unrest and a rapidly deteriorating security environment—exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic—to reconstitute in permissive areas of Iraq and Syria. This chapter examines ISIS’s pandemic-era ground and information operations through the lens of its state-and nation-making efforts to help analysts and decisionmakers better understand the imminence and scope of the threat. We find that ISIS is rapidly overcoming US-supported counterterrorism gains and, without direct pressure to reverse these advances, ISIS is poised for recovery.},
