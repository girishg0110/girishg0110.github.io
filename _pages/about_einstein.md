HiðŸ‘‹! I'm Girish, currently working as a data scientist at BNY Mellon. I build **retrieval-augmented generation apps for legal Q&A and information retrieval**. I earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics (double major) at Rutgers University, where I was active in AI and computational science research. 

My current interests are **graph machine learning and model interpretability**. On a personal note, I'm passionate about STEM education, having co-founded and supported tutoring programs and clubs throughout my school years. 

In my free time, you can find me [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164072167-girish-ganesan), [cubing](), or creating [generative art](https://github.com/girishg0110/Video-Games-and-Art).
