<!-- Tank problem - t_i...t_n
- $P(N|t) = P(t|N)P(N)/P(t)$
- $P(N|t) ~\alpha~ P(t|N)P(N)$
- $P(t|N) = \frac{1}{(N~choose~n)}$
- $P(N) = $
* estimates probability that N tanks were manufactured between the start of the war and the time of observation
* having a crazy number of tanks should be very unlikely
* could have a uniform distribution up to a certain maximum, then 0 probability
* discounted probability by r
* Poisson distribution - exponential?? - what should \lambda = mean #observations be - N?
